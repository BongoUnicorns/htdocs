This application intends to allow mobile access to a simple Bash shell on a remote server.  Logins are managed by a master administrator, and currently all logins have identical administrator-level permissions on the server.  To come is an in-browser replacement for VIM/Nano and a token-based instancing system to allow for simultaneous logins.

This is also the testing file for git committing using the tool.
